# ETH Various Contract

This project showcases the deployment and interaction with Various smart contract. It includes two key scripts: one for deploying the smart contract and another for calling its functions once deployed.

Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

Deployment Script: This script is responsible for deploying the smart contract to your desired network. It handles the necessary configurations, ensuring that the contract is deployed correctly.

Interaction Script: Once the contract is deployed, this script allows you to interact with it by calling its functions. It demonstrates how to execute different contract functions and retrieve data.
